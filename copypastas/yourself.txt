What does "being yourself" even mean?

It means the biggest fucking lie you were ever told. Let me explain:

"Being yourself" TM is a product of the self esteem movement. It's what we were force fed by the western narrative, constructed by movies, tv and the media to feel good about ourselves, rather than improve.

The reason why its such a poisonous idea is that its the antithesis to growth. And its being offered as a medicine to every thing.

Cant get women? Just be yourself man.

Cant get friends? Just be yourself man.

If the solution is always being more true to the inside than being more attentive to the outside, there is no room for improvement.

Heres a small secret - when people tell you to "just be yourself" they have the already awesome at mind.

When women tell you "just be yourself" you think they want a 30 year old, living in his moms basement, WoW grinding, hentai watching, waifu pillow hugging, socially awkward virgin to be authentic?

Yes you need to be authentic to yourself. Don't pretend to like something you don't like or change your opinions based on who you talk to. Thats lame.

But beyond that, "being yourself" is the worst thing you can do. You need to constantly evolve to be the quality person other quality people want to be around with.

And that means not being "naturally timid". Who cares if thats who you are naturally. Im naturally autistic (aspergers), but that didn't prevent me from learning social skills.

If you were naturally fat would that means you shouldn't get on the treadmill?

Stop using what you are "naturally" as an excuse. Growth is beating what you are naturally to a pulp until you can't recognize yourself anymore. Go out. Talk to as many people as you can. Read body language books. Be a better listener. Be greater than your circumstances.
